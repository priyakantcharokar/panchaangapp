# Kaal Calculator App

## Overview

The Kaal Calculator App is a specialized tool designed for calculating various astrological periods (Kaals) based on Vedic astrology. It provides users with the ability to select a date and obtain the timings for different Kaals such as Rahu Kaal, Gulika Kaal, Yamaganda Kaal, and Abhijit Muhurat. Each Kaal has its unique significance and is traditionally used for planning and executing various activities in daily life.

## Features

- **Date Selection**: Users can easily select any date using the built-in date picker.
- **Kaal Calculations**: The app calculates the timing for various Kaals based on the selected date. The current version includes:
    - Rahu Kaal: A period considered inauspicious for starting new activities.
    - Gulika Kaal: Another inauspicious period, believed to bring obstacles.
    - Yamaganda Kaal: A time frame to avoid for commencing important tasks.
    - Abhijit Muhurat: Considered a highly auspicious time, ideal for new beginnings.
- **Information Display**: Each Kaal is accompanied by an information icon. When tapped, it displays a detailed description of the Kaal, helping users understand its significance.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A user-friendly interface ensures easy navigation and interaction within the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter, a popular open-source UI software development kit by Google. Flutter allows for the creation of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: The primary programming language used is Dart, which is optimized for building UIs with features like hot-reload and a reactive framework.
- **Intl Package**: This Dart package provides internationalization and localization capabilities, including date/time formatting, which is crucial for the app's functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the Kaal Calculator App on your local machine, ensure you have Flutter installed and set up. Clone the repository to your device, navigate to the project directory, and execute `flutter run`. The app should launch on your connected emulator or device.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with an astronomical API for accurate calculation of Kaals based on geographical location.
